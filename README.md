# Syncvas (Synchronous Drawing Canvas)
A basic drawing app demo for users to draw on the same canvas on different devices and have everything synchronised between them.

WebSockets are used for communication and Node.js + express is used for the backend, while React is used for the frontend

It's not meant to be a full-featured drawing app, but just for basic illustrative purposes so far.
